<blockquote>
 "just as some argue that Medici money was a mixed blessing for art,
 will the same be said after tech moguls have put their stamp financially
 on contemporary art? Silicon Valley may save the art world, but what will
 that art world look like afterwards?"

<h3>Quotes on Language</h3>

<blockquote>
  "Because the process of knowing is inseparable from
  "languaging," in the new education, language (i.e., all forms of
  symbolic codification) is regarded as the mediator of all human
  perception and is used as a unifying and continuing focus of all
  student inquiry."
  &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman"> Neil Postman</a>
  and

<blockquote>
  "Language is a process of free creation; its laws and principles
  are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation
  are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation
  and use of words involves a process of free creation."
  &mdash; <a href =

</blockquote>
    
    
<blockquote>
  "Journalists say that when a dog bites a man, that is not news,
  but when a man bites a dog that is news.  This is the essence of
  the langauge instinct: language conveys news."  &mdash;
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker">Steven Pinker</a>
</blockquote>    

<blockquote>
  "Language disguises thought."
