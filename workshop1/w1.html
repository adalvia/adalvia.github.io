  "just as the arts is the secretion of any given society's culture,
  the culture of this society - conversely - is the mirror and 
  outcome of these arts." &mdash; <a href =

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  "some are concerned that art that is created digitally 
  is an inauthentic version of the medium it is exploring.
  conversely, artists who honed their craft decades ago 
  are beginning to embrace and delight in technology that
  has allowed them to create art in new ways." &mdash; <a href =
